/// So we'll provide an implementation for our Sample type based on total_cmp
///
/// f32 doesn't have an Ord implementation by default.
/// But it does have a total ordering.
///
/// The normal definition of a total ordering on a set is when any two
/// elements of a set are comparable.  Below some of the details
/// of comparisons between floating point values are outlined.
///
/// Positive and negative zero
/// The common IEEE standard for floating point, IEEE 754, has a
/// signed zero.  There exist two zeros, +0 and -0.
/// It's unclear how these should be ordered for this use case.
///
/// Positive and negative infinity
/// IEEE 754 has both positive and negative infinity
/// Defining negative infinity as less than positive infinity usually
/// makes sense.
/// But there can be issues, because Rust total_cmp defines INFINITY
/// as greater than MAX.
///
/// NaN
/// IEEE 754 has a NaN result or element.  It may not make sense to compare this
/// element to other elements for ordering, depending on your application.
///
/// When we sample from a distribution, normally NaN and infinity are not considered valid
/// values or elements.  So we can ignore how those values are compared.
/// We may generate infinity when normalizing or for distributions
/// with large sample sizes.
/// Zero does matter, because it can be sampled.  But we only consider
/// one of the zeros usually.
/// We could add additional type constraints to the Sample type to make this more clear.
///
/// total_cmp does order NaN \
/// total_cmp orders -0.0 as less than 0.0 \
/// total_cmp orders -infinity as less than infinity
